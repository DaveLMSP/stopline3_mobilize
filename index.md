## Hear the Call
Indigenous Water Protectors fighting Line 3 in Minnesota have put out a call:

> Show up to support the front lines. 

At the moment:
- Enbridge is close to crossing the 22 waterways that Water Protectors are trying to protect. 
  * Enbridge is devastating the Water Protectors' wild rice wetlands and forests around there in the process.
- At the end of March, Enbridge must renew $2.2 billion in loans from 18 banks, and we want to stop that money pipeline.
- With thousands of out-of-state workers, the man camps are a threat to Indigenous women as well as a huge Covid hazard. 
- If constructed, Enbridge's tar sands pipeline would produce as many emissions as 50 coal power plants, exacerbating the climate emergency. 
  - *Given the momentum from the KXL cancellation, we need to push the Biden administration to cancel Line 3 and DAPL as well.*
    
**The time is now!**
