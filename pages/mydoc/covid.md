## Covid Requirements
For the safety of both you and those at the camp, please respect the following:

- You need to present proof that, within 48 hours of joining any camp, you tested negative.
  - This is what indigenous leaders said. If you're coming from thousands of miles away, this may be difficult, so we recommend:
      * Schedule your test so that you get your test results _before_ you leave.
      * Quarantine while you await those results.
      * If you test negative, save the results and quarantine with the covid pod that will travel with you to Minnesota. 
      * Be prepared to show your results to those at the camp.
      * It's possible that indigenous members may ask you to exercise more caution, if they feel your covid precautions aren't sufficiently
        robust. Please be prepared to abide by any such request.
  - **_Please carry proof that you tested negative_**. Without proof, you cannot be admitted to any camp.
- At all times, you need to remain socially distanced from all others except those in your covid pod.
- Whenever in a camp, you need to be masked at all times.
